# Concrete Strength Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for predicting the compressive strength of concrete based on its composition and age using various machine learning models.

---

**Problem Statement**

Predict the compressive strength of concrete using its composition (cement, slag, ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate) and age.

---

**Features**

- Data loading and exploration
- Data visualization
- Preprocessing and feature scaling
- Model training and evaluation using:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor
  - XGBoost Regressor
- Model comparison and performance metrics

---

**Dataset**

The dataset should be in CSV format and contain the following columns:

- cement
- slag
- ash
- water
- superplastic
- coarseagg
- fineagg
- age
- strength

---

**Usage**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnishGitFlow/concrete_strength.git
   cd concrete_strength
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook concrete_strength.ipynb
   ```

4. Ensure the dataset CSV is in the same directory or update the notebook path as needed.

---

**Requirements**

See `requirements.txt` for the full list of dependencies.

---

**Recommendations**

- For reproducibility, use a virtual environment.
- The notebook uses XGBoost, which may require additional system dependencies on some platforms.
- To extend the project, consider adding hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, or model explainability (e.g., SHAP values).
- For large datasets, consider optimizing memory usage or using cloud-based notebooks.

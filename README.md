# Concrete Compressive Strength Prediction

This project predicts the compressive strength of concrete using a regression model trained on the UCI Concrete Compressive Strength dataset. It explores feature relationships, performs preprocessing, trains several models (like Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.), and evaluates their performance.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is this [concrete_strength.csv](https://github.com/AnishGitFlow/ML-concrete-strength-regression/blob/main/concrete_data.csv) and contains features like:

- Cement
- Blast Furnace Slag
- Fly Ash
- Water
- Superplasticizer
- Coarse Aggregate
- Fine Aggregate
- Age (in days)

## 🚀 Project Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Correlation heatmap and scatter plots
- Multiple regression models
- Evaluation using RMSE, R²
- Train-test splitting and model comparison

## 📦 Requirements

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
